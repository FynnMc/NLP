# NLP

Analysis of IMBD review database using various NLP techniques.

Classification accuracy significantly improved via RNN implementation (bulk of code pulled from Raschka analysis) vs simple Bag of words implementation.

Good for reviewing the following:
- BoW (Feature Vector, tf-idf, stemming and tokenisation)
- General text cleaning a processing
- Unsupervised clustering via LDA and classification improvement with RNNs
